# Background
Have you ever wondered, what lectures are being taught in a building? Or even a particular room? 
Ever thought about sneaking into a lecture?
Search no more. This is the tool you desired -- Find lectures by buildings and rooms.

Say you want day&time of all the lectures in Burnside -- with Minerva, you can't. On Minerva, you can only find lecture sections by subject code and course number. **Find A Course** is therefore made.
